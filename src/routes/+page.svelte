<h1>Simple beer league team manager.</h1>

<h2>Easily manage your roster, schedule, communications, and accounting.</h2>

<p>
	I know that managing a beer league team can be a pain. I did it for many years. It can be
	demanding, with tasks such as managing game attendance, tracking who paid, and effectively
	communicating changes all in your free time.
</p>

<p>
	There are solutions out there that can bring order to this chaos, but most of them were either too
	complex or didn't quite hit the mark. I wanted a more straightforward solution that could handle
	five specific tasks.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Track attendance for all our games.</li>
	<li>
		Easily communicate changes to the team and get feedback with a messaging and polling system.
	</li>
	<li>Track who has paid (not facilitate the payment).</li>
	<li>Track that specific tasks were completed, such as registering with the league.</li>
	<li>
		Remind players when they still need to set their game attendance, pay, or complete an assigned
		task.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Like any rational person, I couldn't find the solution I wanted, so I decided to create it myself.
	I am developing this site under several guiding principles, with a focus on simplicity and ease of
	use.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>NO ADS EVER!</li>
	<li>
		It's 100% web-based because you shouldn't need to download a 50MB app to see if your goalie will
		be at the next game.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no feature fluff; everything built will focus on accomplishing the abovementioned
		tasks.
	</li>
	<li>Keep the interface clean and free of clutter.</li>
	<li>Be accessible to my customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The website is in development, but if you would like to track its progress, please check out the
	roadmap <span class="text-sm">(coming soon)</span>. Alternatively, you can get in touch with me
	directly through <a href="https://x.com/keithkelly31">X</a>
	(can we just go back to Twitter?) or <a href="https://discord.gg/jsWz45PP">Discord</a>. Thanks.
